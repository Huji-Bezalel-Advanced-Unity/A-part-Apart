# A part Apart

##  About the Game

*A part Apart* is a psychological 2D puzzle-platformer that explores the fragile and shifting relationship between a child and their shadow. The player must control both characters—one living in light, the other confined to darkness—solving puzzles together while facing emotional and narrative tension. 

As the game unfolds, the illusion of choice becomes central: the child turns to the shadow only when it helps him move forward, and discards it when it's no longer useful. The shadow is always there—but its patience is not eternal.

A third presence—the system voice—guides, mocks, and manipulates both characters, slowly pushing them apart, questioning their trust, and turning their bond into a test of control and consequence.

##  Core Mechanics

- **Dual-Control Puzzle Solving**: Navigate the world by switching between the child and the shadow, each with unique abilities.
- **Shadow-Layer Interaction**: The shadow can only move in dark areas and interact with objects within a separate shadow layer.
- **Emotional Choices**: The game includes branching emotional decisions that influence how the two characters interact—but outcomes may defy expectations.
- **AI System Voice**: A manipulative narrator reacts to players' choices, undermining confidence and creating tension.
- **Split-Level Gameplay**: After a key narrative event, the child and the shadow operate in different layers of the screen, representing emotional and physical separation.
- **Betrayal Mechanic (Final Scene)**: The shadow gains a new button that can harm or hinder the child, reflecting the shift in power and trust.
